**Hold Button 2 for 5 seconds**

- Current display mode
- Configured update intervals (weather and transport)
- WiFi status and IP address
- Battery level

### "I want to update the firmware manually"

**Hold Button 3 for 5 seconds**

Triggers an **OTA (Over-The-Air) firmware update** immediately:

- MyStation connects to the update server
- If a new firmware version is available, it downloads and installs it
- The device restarts after a successful update

> 💡 Normally you don't need to do this — OTA updates happen automatically overnight. Use this if you want to
> force an immediate update.

---

### "The device is stuck or behaving incorrectly"

**Slide the power switch to OFF**, then slide it back to ON to restart the device.

> 💡 This device has an embedded battery. The power switch is the correct way to restart it. All saved settings are kept
> after a restart.

---

### "I want to completely reset the device to factory settings"

**Hold Button 1 + Button 2 simultaneously for 5 seconds**

Performs a **Factory Reset**:

- Clears all saved settings (WiFi, stop, configuration)
- Device restarts as if brand new
- You will need to go through the full setup process again

> ⚠️ **This cannot be undone.** Use only when you want to start from scratch.

---

## Temporary Mode Behaviour

When you press a button to switch display modes (Button 1, 2, or 3 short press), the new mode is **temporary**:

- Duration: **2 minutes**
- After 2 minutes, the display reverts to your **configured display mode**
- The temporary mode is indicated visually on the display

This allows you to quickly check weather or departures without permanently changing your configuration.
